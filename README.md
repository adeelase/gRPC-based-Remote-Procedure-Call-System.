# gRPC-based-Remote-Procedure-Call-System.
In this project, I have designed a gRPC-based Remote Procedure Call system wherein the client dispatches two integer arrays to the server. Subsequently, the server efficiently computes the sum of their corresponding indices in parallel through multithreading, returning the result of this operation in the form of another array to the client.
